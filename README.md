# Git-to-Jira: AI-Powered Diff Summaries
## Description
This bot automates Jira comments based on your Git commits. It uses an AI to read your code changes and writes a summary for you.

You just add a flag to your commit message, like [autocomment], and the bot does the rest. It finds the Jira ticket and posts a clear summary of your code changes as a comment.

This saves time and keeps your team informed without extra work.
